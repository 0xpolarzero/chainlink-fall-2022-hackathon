# Overview

## What is it? Why?

Promise is a blockchain service for founders, creators and regular users. The end purpose is to improve trust in our digital relationships and make founders more accountable for their promises. It is both a way for gathering information about a team and their project, and for them to make a genuine commitment that cannot be altered.

This tool cannot enforce compliance with an objective or a commitment. But, one can imagine that such a process, if it became usual, could provide a much appreciated transparency and permanence in the \*Web3\* space, and more extensively in projects that involve significant investments.

### For founders

A tool to introduce a team, or just themselves, using their digital identity: Ethereum address, Twitter account. That, associated with a communication of their project: roadmap, letter of intent, diagrams, or just an idea...

They can create a promise, add team members, associate their Twitter account with an Ethereum address, and verify it through a transparent and non-intrusive method. The promise is backed up with any relevant documents, ensuring their permanence and availability. Once the promise has been approved by all involved, it can be locked, thereby freezing it irrevocably on the blockchain.

### For users

We are familiar with the terms of \*roadmap\*, \*utility\*, and used to discovering a fine defined schedule when a new project is introduced. While this can be submitted as a blog, website or Twitter thread, \*promise\* is a way to know more about this project, with the assurance that this introduction will not be altered as the project matures and the expectations evolve and expectations might shift.

It can as well be used as an explorer, to find out which projects a Twitter user, or an Ethereum address, might be involved in. Or just to check if an address is tied with a Twitter account, and the other way around.

## How?

This App makes use of Chainlink services to perform various verifications on the blockchain, which are carried out in an open, transparent and trust-minimized process. The data uploaded during the creation of a promise is sent both to the IPFS network & the Arweave blockchain, which guarantees its decentralized distribution through a permanent and inclusive solution. Finally, deploying on Polygon lets us, among others, achieve quick and cheap transactions, thus ensuring a smooth experience for users.

The following is a summary of how these technologies are leveraged. More extensive explanation can be found in specific sections.
