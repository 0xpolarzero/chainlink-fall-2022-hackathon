# Exploring promises

## Introduction

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt="How to reach the &#x27;Explore promises&#x27; page from the website"><figcaption><p>Go to the <em>Explore promises</em> page from the menu.</p></figcaption></figure>

The _Explore Promises_ page shows the last created promises, and allows you to search through the available content. You can make a search using a promise name, an Ethereum address, the name or the Twitter handle of a participant.

## What does a promise look like?

All information and variables of the promise are stored on-chain, in its own smart contract, and fetched before it can be displayed. The content is requested from IPFS to be displayed as well. There are various sections in the promise card:

<details>

<summary>Contract address</summary>

The address of the contract, generated by the factory when the promise was created. It holds all information, and only its participants can interact with it.

</details>

<details>

<summary>IPFS CID</summary>

The IPFS hash pointing to the content uploaded by the creator of the promise.

</details>

<details>

<summary>The verification status</summary>

Shown as a Ribbon, the verification status is the result of the request to the Chainlink External Adapter, to verify the issuance of the promise, and therefore the reliability of the provided links (cf. [ipfs-and-arweave-verification.md](../chainlink-external-adapters/ipfs-and-arweave-verification.md "mention")).

It can hold various states:

_Verification pending..._

\-> The promise was just created, and it is not yet verified.

_Not verified_

\-> The External Adapter could not verify the promise, which means that it was not created through the App. Therefore, the source of the IPFS CID & Arweave ID cannot be insured.

_Verified (IPFS)_

\-> The promise was created using the App. Thus, a deal was made for us to pick up (pin) the content of the promise, through the Filecoin network (cf. [sending-to-the-ipfs-network.md](../ipfs-and-arweave/sending-to-the-ipfs-network.md "mention")).

_Verified (IPFS & Arweave)_

\-> Everything mentioned above + the content was _zipped_ and sent permanently to the Arweave blockchain, using Bundlr. The archive can be downloaded from Arweave by clicking a link, shown when hovering on the badge.
