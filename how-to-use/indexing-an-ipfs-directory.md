# Indexing an IPFS directory

Each promise, provided with a valid IPFS CID, displays the current indexing status of the IPFS directory it points to. Everyone can copy this CID, and proceeds to indexing it. Contributing to the network in such ways ensures that this content will be permanently available - for as long as it is indexed by peers.

## How to set up an IPFS Node?&#x20;

There are multiple ways to set up an IPFS node, and start indexing content, including:

* from the command-line
* using a native browser built-in node (e.g. Brave)
* using IPFS Desktop

The complexity varies depending on the option. [This guide](https://docs.ipfs.tech/how-to/companion-node-types/) is a great way for exploring available methods, while we will only introduce the last one of this list (IPFS Desktop). It is probably the easiest method to deal with, since it installs and manages the local node for the user, as well as offering a helpful interface for managing it.
